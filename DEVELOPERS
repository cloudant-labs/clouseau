Running a local dev cluster
---------------------------

In separate terminal windows, run each of these commands;

mvn scala:run -Dlauncher=clouseau1

mvn scala:run -Dlauncher=clouseau2

mvn scala:run -Dlauncher=clouseau3

If you are using the 'dreyfus' branch of dbcore, then each erlang node
will already be configured to talk to its clouseau peer. If not, you
go right ahead and do that by hand.

Example call: dreyfus:search(<<"db1">>, <<"text:text">>, [{limit, 5}]).
