Running a local dev cluster
---------------------------

In separate terminal windows, run each of these commands;

mvn scala:run -Dlauncher=clouseau1

mvn scala:run -Dlauncher=clouseau2

mvn scala:run -Dlauncher=clouseau3

If you are using the 'dreyfus' branch of dbcore, then each erlang node
will already be configured to talk to its clouseau peer. If not, you
go right ahead and do that by hand.

Deploying to production
-----------------------

On your local machine:
1. Update pom.xml to a new version: e.g remove <version>2.11.4-SNAPSHOT</version>, update to the next new version number <version>2.11.4</version>. Commit changes.
2. Make a new annotated tag:
    git tag -a 2.11.4
3. Update pom.xml to a new SNAPSHOT tag:  <version>2.11.5-SNAPSHOT</version>. Commit changes.
4. Build clouseau on your local machine:
    4.0 git checkout tags/2.11.4
    4.1 Ensuring that jdk6 on the path
    4.2 Make sure there is no trash
        git clean -xdff
    4.3. mvn clean package
5. If built is successful and all tests are passed, push the commits and the new tag into the origin (git push --tags). 
6. Deploy package .zip file:
Scp to home dir rsync -avz target/*.zip deployer.cloudant.com:/home/<USER>
7. Work with the release engineering team after that.
