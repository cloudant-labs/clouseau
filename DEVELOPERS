Running a local dev cluster
---------------------------

In separate terminal windows, run each of these commands;

mvn scala:run -Dlauncher=clouseau1

mvn scala:run -Dlauncher=clouseau2

mvn scala:run -Dlauncher=clouseau3

If you are using the 'dreyfus' branch of dbcore, then each erlang node
will already be configured to talk to its clouseau peer. If not, you
go right ahead and do that by hand.

Deploying to production
-----------------------

1. Update pom.xml to the new version number. Example:  <version>2.10.0</version>.
2. Make a new version tag, which, like the others, includes the list of changes.
3. Build it:
    3.1 Ensuring that jdk6 on the path
    3.2 Make sure there is no trash
        git clean -xdff
        git checkout 2.10.0.
    3.3. mvn clean package
    If built is successful, all tests should pass.
4. Deploy package .zip file:
    4.1 First, scp to home dir
        rsync -avz target/*.zip deployer.cloudant.com:/home/<USER>
    4.2 sudo mv it
        sudo mv clouseau-2.10.0.zip /opt/repo/builds/clouseau/releases/
5. Update pom.xml to the next snapshot version. Example: <version>2.10.1-SNAPSHOT</version>.

NOTE: You might need to change the version attribute in chef to match the
zipfile's version.
