First version is a bit of a hack and uses a single phase. This makes
it impossible to get useful things like the total count of groups,
since there's no way to detect overlap.

An improved version will use the two phase approach. First phase uses
the first phase collector which will tell us the scores of every group
that has *a* match. We dedupe this, sort it, take the top N, and then
we run the second phase asking for the top M docs from each of the top
N groups.
